# About

This is a **legacy** project of Planet Attack game. Most likely it would require some time just to get it to the point that it compile again.
Originally written around 2010/2011 using Java and libGDX. Since libGDX is a cross platform tool, it was mainly designed for Android.

Done just for fun and to learn some new stuff.It was released on Google Play Store, however cuyrrenty it's
no longer available there. (I've found a [mirror](https://apkamp.com/sv/pl.wcja) though;)

Here's a short video of the gameplay.
