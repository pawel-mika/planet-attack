The goal of the game is to take over all of the planets controlled by computer.
You can attack them simply by dragging your finger from your planet to the target planet.
When in need, you can transfer resources between your planets - just drag! Transfer takes
50% of resources and ships from the source planet and sends them to the target. If the
target changed owner during the transfer, transferred ships are used to try win the planet
back (when not succeded, enemy takes transferred resources!).
By single-tapping your planet you select it to be a part of multi-planet action. You can 
then drag a finger from one of the selected planets to the target planet (yours or the enemy).
